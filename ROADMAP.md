Calculating the dawn and sunrise times for a specific location and date requires a combination of astronomical and geographic calculations. Here's one way to do it:

Determine the latitude and longitude of the location for which you want to calculate the dawn and sunrise times. You can find this information using online resources or a GPS device.

Determine the altitude of the location. This is the height above sea level.

Use the latitude and longitude to calculate the time zone of the location. You can use an online tool or reference to do this.

Use the current date and time to calculate the Julian Day (JD) number. The JD number is a continuous count of days and fractions of days since noon Universal Time on January 1, 4713 BCE (Julian calendar). You can find online calculators or formulas to calculate the JD number.

Use the latitude, longitude, altitude, and JD number to calculate the local sidereal time (LST). LST is the time according to the position of the stars, and is necessary for calculating the dawn and sunrise times. You can find online calculators or formulas to calculate the LST.

Use the latitude, altitude, and JD number to calculate the solar declination angle. This is the angle between the rays of the sun and the Earth's equatorial plane, and changes throughout the year. You can find online calculators or formulas to calculate the solar declination angle.

Use the solar declination angle and the latitude to calculate the sunrise hour angle. This is the angle between the horizon and the sun at sunrise. You can find online calculators or formulas to calculate the sunrise hour angle.

Use the sunrise hour angle and the LST to calculate the time of sunrise. This is the moment when the top edge of the sun appears on the horizon.

Use the time of sunrise to calculate the time of dawn, which is when the sky starts to get light. This time can vary depending on the altitude of the location and atmospheric conditions.

There are many online tools and resources available to help you with these calculations, or you can use software specifically designed for astronomy and astrophysics calculations.
